== Description ==

Note: This plugin is not needed for WordPress 2.7+, Consider this plugin abandoned.

dPost Uploads is a plugin designed to allow users to store uploaded media into folders based upon the posts date, rather than the current date.

For example, If i'm editing a post from 2007, And i attach new uploads to it(Say as i'm switching from using Flickr to WordPress's own gallery functions), I may want the uploads to be stored in a folder based on the posts date or December 2007, rather than the currnet date of May 2008. If i select, i can store the uploads into /2007/12/file.jpg rather than /2008/05/file.jpg

This plugin also works with the Add From Server plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-from-server/
